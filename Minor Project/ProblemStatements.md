The objective of the regression analysis is to explore the relationship between the independent variables (such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, etc.) and the dependent variable (happiness score) to build a predictive model. The analysis aims to identify the significant predictors that contribute to the happiness score and quantify their impact.<p>

<h4>üìå Tasks - </h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the distribution of happiness scores in the dataset? How do the scores vary across different countries?</li>
<li>Which factors are most strongly correlated with the happiness score? Can you calculate the correlation coefficients between the happiness score and variables such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption?</li>
<li>Are there any outliers in the dataset for variables like GDP per capita or healthy life expectancy? Can you identify any extreme values and discuss their potential impact on the analysis and model performance?</li>
<li>Can you visualize the relationship between social support and the happiness score using a scatter plot? Does it appear to be a positive or negative relationship?</li>
<li>What is the average level of freedom to make life choices across different countries? Can you calculate the mean freedom score and identify countries with high and low levels of freedom?</li></ul> <br />

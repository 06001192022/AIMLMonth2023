# Problem Statements

<h3>1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis ✒️ </h3>
<p> The problem is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using the sentiment140 dataset. The dataset contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted from the Twitter API. Each tweet is labeled with a polarity value indicating whether it is negative, neutral, or positive sentiment (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive). The goal is to predict the sentiment expressed in a given tweet.<p>

<h4>📌 Tasks - </h4>
<ul>Are there any missing values and duplicate instances in the dataset? If so, how should we handle them?</ul>
<ul>Can we identify any patterns or trends in the tweets based on the date of posting? How does the distribution of sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) look like?</ul>
<ul>Can we identify any relationships between the length of tweets and their corresponding sentiment? Provide correlation plot.</ul>
<ul>How should we encode the categorical variable for sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral)? Binary encoding or one-hot encoding? Perform the encoding.</ul>
<ul>Do we need to remove any special characters, URLs, or mentions from the tweets before analysis? How should we handle emoji or emoticons in the text data? Should we remove or encode them?</ul><br />


<h3>2. Disease Burden by Cause 1990-2019  ✒️ </h3>
<p> The problem is to perform analysis on the "Disease Burden by Cause" dataset, which contains information about the disease burden caused by various factors in different countries from 1990 to 2019. The objective is to explore the relationship between independent variables (such as risk factors, causes, and demographic factors) and the dependent variable (disease burden) in order to build a predictive model.<p>

<h4>📌 Tasks - </h4>
<ul>Are there any missing values and duplicate instances in the dataset? If so, how do you plan to handle them?</ul>
<ul>What is the distribution of the disease burden (DALYs) across different sub-categories of disease or injury?</ul>
<ul>How does the disease burden vary across different countries  or regions and years? Are there any significant trends or patterns? How does the disease burden vary across different demographic factors, such as age groups or gender?</ul>
<ul>Can we identify any outliers or extreme values in the disease burden data? How do they impact the overall analysis? Perform required visualization task.</ul>
<ul>Perform preprocessing and normalization on the data? How data normalization will help you in model training and prediction.</ul><br />

<h3 id="project1">1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis ‚úí </h3>
<p> The problem is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using the sentiment140 dataset. The dataset contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted from the Twitter API. Each tweet is labeled with a polarity value indicating whether it is negative, neutral, or positive sentiment (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive). The goal is to predict the sentiment expressed in a given tweet.<p>
<h4>üë©‚Äçüíª Dataset - </h4><p>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140<p>
<h4>üìå Tasks - </h4>
<ul>Are there any missing values and duplicate instances in the dataset? If so, how should we handle them?</ul>
<ul>Can we identify any patterns or trends in the tweets based on the date of posting? How does the distribution of sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) look like?</ul>
<ul>Can we identify any relationships between the length of tweets and their corresponding sentiment? Provide correlation plot.</ul>
<ul>How should we encode the categorical variable for sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral)? Binary encoding or one-hot encoding? Perform the encoding.</ul>
<ul>Do we need to remove any special characters, URLs, or mentions from the tweets before analysis? How should we handle emoji or emoticons in the text data? Should we remove or encode them?</ul><br />


<h3 id="project2">2. Disease Burden by Cause 1990-2019  ‚úí </h3>
<p> The problem is to perform analysis on the "Disease Burden by Cause" dataset, which contains information about the disease burden caused by various factors in different countries from 1990 to 2019. The objective is to explore the relationship between independent variables (such as risk factors, causes, and demographic factors) and the dependent variable (disease burden) in order to build a predictive model.<p>
<h4>üë©‚Äçüíª Dataset - </h4><p>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivkumarganesh/disease-burden-by-cause<p>
<h4>üìå Tasks - </h4>
<ul>Are there any missing values and duplicate instances in the dataset? If so, how do you plan to handle them?</ul>
<ul>What is the distribution of the disease burden (DALYs) across different sub-categories of disease or injury?</ul>
<ul>How does the disease burden vary across different countries  or regions and years? Are there any significant trends or patterns? How does the disease burden vary across different demographic factors, such as age groups or gender?</ul>
<ul>Can we identify any outliers or extreme values in the disease burden data? How do they impact the overall analysis? Perform required visualization task.</ul>
<ul>Perform preprocessing and normalization on the data? How data normalization will help you in model training and prediction.</ul><br />


<h3 id="project3">3. Gender Development Index 2019   ‚úí </h3>
<p> The problem is to perform analysis on the "Gender Development Index 2019" dataset, which provides information to measure gender inequality in different countries based on health, education, and income indicators. The objective is to examine the relationship between independent variables (such as education, health, and income) and the dependent variable (gender development index) to build a predictive model. The analysis aims to identify the key factors that contribute to gender development disparities across different regions and countries.<p>
<h4>üë©‚Äçüíª Dataset - </h4><p>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/gender-development-index-2019<p>
<h4>üìå Tasks - </h4>
<ul>Are there any missing values and duplicate instances in the dataset? How will you handle them?</ul>
<ul>How does the gender development index vary across different regions or countries? Can you identify any significant regional disparities? Are there any significant differences in gender development between different income groups or regions?</ul>
<ul>Can you identify any outliers or extreme values in the variables related to health, education, or income? How might these outliers affect the analysis?</ul>
<ul>What are the relationships or correlations between the independent variables (education, health, income) and the dependent variable (gender development index)? Are there any notable trends or patterns?</ul>
<ul>How can we preprocess and normalize the data? How data normalization will help you in model training and prediction?</ul><br />


<h3 id="project4">4. Factors affecting Campus Placement  ‚úí </h3>
<p> The problem is to perform analysis on the "Factors Affecting Campus Placement" dataset, which contains information about various factors that may influence the placement outcomes of students in a university campus. The objective is to understand the relationship between independent variables (such as gender, educational background, specialization, work experience, etc.) and the dependent variable (placement status) in order to build a predictive model.<p>
<h4>üë©‚Äçüíª Dataset - </h4><p>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement<p>
<h4>üìå Tasks - </h4>
<ul>Are there any missing values and duplicate records in the dataset? How will you identify and handle them? Can you identify any other inconsistencies or errors in the data that require cleaning or validation?</ul>
<ul>What is the distribution of placement status based on different categorical variables (e.g., gender, specialisation)? Are there any significant differences or patterns in the placement rates among different groups?  Can we identify any correlation between specific independent variables (such as educational background, work experience, etc.) and the placement status?</ul>
<ul>How does the distribution of secondary and higher secondary school percentages vary among the placed and not-placed students? Can you identify any significant differences or patterns?</ul>
<ul>What is the distribution of the salary offers for placed students? What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median salary values? Are there any notable patterns or outliers in the data? Perform required visualization.</ul>
<ul>How can we preprocess and normalize the data? How data normalization will help you in model training and prediction?</ul><br />
